SEL-3378 SVP Configurator 
Version: 2.3.7.2-2.2-1
Date Code: 20140805


SEL-3378 SVP Configurator process 'Gateway.exe' can be abuse to create arbitrary files
as the currently logged in user.

The 'Gateway.exe' process is started once a project is loaded and the login
button is clicked (1.PNG). The process listens on TCP ports 1210 and 1211 (2.PNG). Both
ports are reachable from the network. The 'Gateway.exe' process allows for
various actions to be passed to it via opcodes. Opcode 6 (calls CreateFileA()) allows for file
creation (3.PNG). By abusing this, an attacker can run arbitrary code in the
context of the currently logged in user (My poc simply creates a file in 
%SYSTEMDRIVE%).
