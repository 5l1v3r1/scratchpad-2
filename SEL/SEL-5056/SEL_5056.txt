SEL-5056 Flow Controller 
Version: 1.4.0.0
Date Code: 20180301

The issue is that a unprivileged local (or remote, depending how 
the software is commissioned) attacker can gain elevated operating system 
privileges (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) on a host running the SEL-5056 
Flow Controller enterprise software. 

Two vulnerabilities, a directory traversal and binary planting
allow for successful exploitation.

The directory traversal is due to a old version of the 
Ionic Zip Library being used to explode the zip archive
when restoring a database. When the archive gets extracted,
the library does not check paths and can be abused to place
arbitrary files into arbitrary locations (Flow Controller should
santized the content of any archive for something other than a
database file?).

The binary planting issue is due to the main service process
for Flow Controller resolving library's that don't exist on the
file system. When the database archive is uploaded, the Flow Controller
process restarts. With this restart, any library that is missing (which I
replace) will get loaded and run as the main process privileges 
(NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM). 

The missing library's could be something that may have existed in the
developer's enviroment? My exploit uses 'VERSION.dll', but there
are others that can be used.
